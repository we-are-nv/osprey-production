The tank is protected by a frame in AISI316 stainless steel.

The optional float switch prevents the washer unit from running dry and causing damage to the pump. It is wired into the washer power supply unit so when the water level drops to a specific level the power to the pump is cut. The alarm output can be connected to the camera to indicate when the bottle needs refilling.\n",

This\nallows simple installation and reliable\nUPS-backed central power delivery\nto IP cameras. It delivers\nthe full 25.5W required for POE+ equipment at up to 600 metres, or\nstandard 15W POE at up to 820\nmetres. The system  also supports 1-pair and\n2-pair cable with extended range,\nautomatically adapting to the available\npairs. Analogue cameras in UTP\ninstallations can be upgraded\nto IP with no need to replace the\ninstalled cabling infrastructure.\nFor even more extreme distances,\nthe devices can automatically\ndrop to 10Base-T operation, supporting\na range of over 1000 metres (3,280ft).",

It is therefore suitable for applications on-board where it is not possible, or difficult, to run a cable to a camera location.  Examples include transmission from the bow, or crane, to the bridge.  The units require 24vdc which can be provided by a 230vac powers supply.  Both thr transmitter and receiver units are housed in an IP67 enclosure to protect them against water ingress. Suitable for Point-to-Point and Multi-point deployment. Robust link, easy installation, small and easy to handle. Excellent throughput . ",

MTBF is 7 years.\nIt's 3MP, 30x zoom camera module has exceptional low-light capability; H265, H264 and MJPEG compression; intelligent analytics and tracking. IR detection distances exceed 300m at night.\nIts Marine Paint finish designed to give enhanced corrosion resistance of aluminum and mild steel. The gloss finish is an ultra-durable coating conforming to the requirements of EN 12206 and EN 13438 (High Durability systems). The camera is available in Marine White, Light Grey and Black. The combination of ultra-durable paint and its Dome Cover, which acts as a sunshield, helps to reduce extremes of temperature in direct sunlight. Conversely, the dome cover also provides a level of insulation in cold environments and additional protection to the dome mechanism in marine applications. ",
