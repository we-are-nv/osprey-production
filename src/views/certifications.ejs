        <p>It’s very important to ensure that the equipment you’re proposing to use is suitable for its purpose taking account of the law, applicable standards, quality, safety, security, reliability and environmental. You will therefore need to consider elements including temperature, vibration, humidity, IP protection, safety, EMC and cybersecurity. We detail below some of the more common certifications used to ensure the suitability of components and systems to face marine and oil & gas hazards. </p>

          <h2> ATEX</h2>
          When electronic or electrical equipment of any type is intended for use in a hazardous area, it must be ATEX certified as required by the EU directive 94/9/EC (the ATEX directive (ATmospheres EXplosives). Products for use in hazardous areas need to comply with ISO/IEC 80079-34:2018 which defines the quality system required to manufacture Ex products in accordance with the relevant certifications. In Europe, ATEX certification of products for use in potentially hazardous atmospheres is compulsory. Hazardous areas exist where a potentially explosive mix of air and flammable gasses or air and dust or air, dust and gasses may occur. Outside the EU, similar regulations apply under the IECEX certification system (see video https://www.iecex.com/assets/Uploads/Video/IECEx-Introduction-Animation-2021-MP4-1080G.mp4). In North America, products must be listed by UL as suitable for use in hazardous atmospheres. Whilst ATEX and IECEX certification systems are similar, the North American approach is different (see area classification below).
          <h3>Classification of Equipment</h3>
          The ATEX directive classifies equipment into groups and categories which is shown on the ATEX product marking table below.
          <h3>Classification of an Area</h3>
          Hazardous areas are divided into Zones (European and IECEX method) or Classes and Divisions (North American method) according to the likelihood of a potentially explosive atmosphere being present.

          <h2>Ingress Protection</h2>
          <h3>IP Classification</h3>
          <p>An IP Rating (also known as Ingress Protection Rating or International Protection Rating) is a way of showing the effectiveness of electrical enclosures in blocking foreign bodies such as dust, moisture, liquids and accidental contact. Ingress Protection (IP) ratings measure how resistant a device is against solids and water. IP ratings are determined by the international standard EN 60529 (British BS EN 60529:1992 – Degrees of protection provided by enclosures (IP Code) and European IEC 60509: 1989 – Degrees of protection provided by enclosures (IP Code).
            IP ratings consist of the letters IP (Ingress Protection), followed by two digits. The higher the number after IP, the better the protection against foreign bodies. Sometimes a number is replaced by an X. This indicates that the enclosure is not yet rated for that specification.
            The first digit of the IP rating indicates the level of the enclosure’s protection against the ingress from blocking solid foreign bodies such as dust, tools or fingers that could be hazardous if were to come into contact with electrical components, parts or circuitry within the enclosure.
            The second digit of the IP rating indicates the level of the enclosure’s protection from blocking internal components against various forms of moisture (sprays, drips or submersion etc).
          </p>

          <p>For CCTV camera housings used in the marine environment, the devices need to be “totally protected against dust” to ensure no salt or sand can enter the enclosure. For liquid protection, where cameras are exposed, you will normally require a minimum liquids rating of 7. However, in locations subject to frequent or strong sea-spray a liquids protection of 8 is recommended. So in practice, cameras used externally on vessels will need to be IP67 or IP68 rated.</p>

          <p>The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) defines standards used in North America for various grades of electrical enclosures typically used in industrial applications.
