        <h3>Security Management Software</h3><br> The SMS is a ruggedised digital marine CCTV system. The system is intended for vessels requiring a rugged, commercial-off-the-shelf surveillance monitoring, control & recording, marine CCTV system, designed to meet the safety, security and reliability requirements for a wide variety of commercial vessels. The SMS System offers improved operational efficiency as well as an integrated working environment for safe and effective monitoring of critical vessel operations and the deployment and movement of ship personnel.<br><br>
        The system design allows for flexible configuration of operator stations together with a wide choice of camera viewing solutions with specific camera designs to suit all top-deck, below-deck and subsea monitoring applications. The system components can take full advantage of the latest IP network and Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) cabling infrastructure to simplify installation requirements, increase flexibility and significantly reduce vessel installation costs. Options are available to pass high resolution IP camera signals over existing analogue coaxial cables if required. The system architecture allows for cost effective, scalable installations on various vessels of all sizes, ranging from requirements for only a few cameras, up to larger vessel requirements for integrated systems with hundreds of cameras. <br><br>

        <h3>System Configuration</h3><br>
        The SMS System open architecture design allows for scalable custom installations on vessels of any size, with single, or multiple operator stations and multiple camera installations ranging from a few to several hundred. The Security Management Software (SMS) is installed on a scalable network server configuration, housed in an appropriate rack cabinet assembly together with the network switches and an optional UPS back-up in the vent of main system power failure.<br><br>
        CCTV and security systems can be managed and controlled by our Security Management System (SMS) which integrates all your security elements on one Graphical User Interface (GUI) so CCTV, access control, intercoms and alarms are all displayed together. For example, if a door forced alarm is created by the access control system, the CCTV camera viewing this door will display on the control room monitor with an audible alarm to alert the operator. Recording frame rate will increase during the alarm period.<br><br>
